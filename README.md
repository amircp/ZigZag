#Zig Zag Technical Indicator

The intention of this repository is to build a set of technical indicators tools, currently i have  created the "ZigZag" indicator it is still in "build process":

**Â¿What is Zig Zag?**
The zig zag indicator is a basic tool that analysts use to find out when a security's trend is reversing. By determining the support and resistance areas, it helps to identify significant changes in price while filtering out short-term fluctuations, thus eliminating the noise of everyday market conditions. It is an excellent tool for any trader who follows indicators that use swing highs and swing lows.
